                <t>USPS being a moron!</t>  
                <body>
                USPS really is a moron especially for shipping out of the USA. A familly member of mine has recently shipped be two packages. They were a Surface 3 + a charger and a keyboard. The Surface 3 + the charger were sent first. The first problem <i>is</i> that the tracking number they gave me for the first package is incorrect, like literally incorrect and I can't do anything about it. The best part is that the fucking keyboard arrived first! I literally can't do anything with the keyboard as the keyboard needs the Surface 3. Guess I will have to wait for the Surface 3 to arrive. I will write a blogpost about the Surface 3 when it arrives so follow the RSS feed for that!
