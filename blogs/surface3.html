                <t>Using the Surface 3 in 2022.</t>
                <body>
                Using the Surface 3 in 2022 is preety doable. Im writng this "blogpost" on the Atom editor and, of course, the Surfce 3! Mine came with Windows 10, which sucks. So I downgraded it to the original OS, Windows 8.1. The first thing I found weird was that Windows 8.1 with no updates does not have the Surface 3 drivers, NONE! Not even WiFi or the touchscreen! (Windows 8.1 was made for touchscreen devices in mind.) So, after finding the correct drivers. coppied them to a pendrive and installing them, it worked fine. I actually noticed that Windows 8.1 Pro got auto activated which was wierd. Windows 8.1 isnt that laggy. YouTube videos play good if you watch in 720p. Since i'm a moron I didn't get a higher storage model and got the 64gb version, so I can't install Arch Linux until I add an SD Card.

                  TL:DR, I got the Surface 3 and it works.
